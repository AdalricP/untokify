Stands for "un-tiktokify my effin twitter feed"

Load the unpacked extension and it should work when you open twitter from the extensions panel. 

You can use the slider to decide if you don't want to block anything (why), or if you want to only block videos or also images. You can also decide if you only want media from people you follow.

I made this because I've been trying to get rid of all forms of non-text based social media usage lately
